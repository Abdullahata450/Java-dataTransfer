# Java Data Transfer Application

This Java application showcases data transfer between JPanels within the same JFrame and between different JFrames.

## Description

The application provides functionality to transfer data between visual components (JPanels) within a single window (JFrame) and between separate windows (JFrames). It illustrates how data can be passed from one panel to another within the same frame and between frames in a Java Swing application.

## Features

### Transfer Within the Same JFrame
- **Transfer within JPanels**: Demonstrates data transfer between JPanels within the same JFrame.
- **Components Interaction**: Allows users to input data in one panel and transfer it to another within the same window.

### Transfer Between Different JFrames
- **Transfer between JFrames**: Illustrates passing data from one JFrame to another.
- **Separate Window Interaction**: Provides functionality to transfer data between different windows (JFrames).

## Technologies Used

- Java Swing for GUI components and window management.

## Usage

### Transfer within the Same JFrame
1. Launch the application.
2. Enter data in the input field of one JPanel.
3. Trigger the data transfer action to move the entered data to another JPanel within the same JFrame.

### Transfer Between Different JFrames
1. Launch the application.
2. Enter data in the input field of one JFrame.
3. Trigger the data transfer action to open another JFrame and display the transferred data.

## Note

This README provides a high-level overview of the application's functionality. Refer to the source code for detailed implementation and specifics of the data transfer mechanisms.
